# DLL ↔ Relay contract (frozen before Phase 2)

This is the wire format the DLL (`Modules/LobbyShare.cs`) and the Worker
(`relay/src/index.ts`) agree on. Both sides must follow it byte-for-byte
or signatures break.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/announce` | new lobby created — or, if same host re-announces existing code, PATCH the embed in place (handles Play-Again / player-count refreshes) |
| `POST` | `/api/start` | game has started — PATCH embed to in-game (amber) |
| `POST` | `/api/end` | game finished — PATCH embed back to "open" (blurple). Lobby is still alive; same code is rejoinable |
| `POST` | `/api/close` | host actually left the lobby — DELETE message + KV entry |
| `POST` | `/api/update` | live update of player count / max / mode (status preserved) — DLL fires throttled (~5s diff-detect) during the lobby phase |

All three require these headers:

```
X-Timestamp: <unix seconds, no fraction>
X-Signature: <hex sha256 HMAC>
content-type: application/json
```

`X-Signature` is computed as:

```
HMAC_SHA256(key = <DLL's baked HMAC key>, message = X-Timestamp + "." + raw_request_body)
```

- The body MUST be the exact bytes sent on the wire (no whitespace re-normalization)
- Each DLL release has **one** HMAC key baked in. The Worker holds a
  comma-separated list (`SHARED_HMAC_KEYS`) of currently-accepted keys; any
  signature that verifies under at least one listed key is accepted. This is
  how rotation stays non-breaking — add new key, ship new DLL, drop old key
  after grace.
- Skew tolerance: ±300 seconds

If signature is invalid or timestamp is skewed, the relay responds `401 bad signature`.

## Bodies

### `POST /api/announce`

```json
{
  "code":       "ABCDEF",
  "region":     "NA",
  "players":    3,
  "max":        15,
  "mode":       "Standard",
  "modVersion": "0.3.0-alpha",
  "hostName":   "WafflePlayer",
  "fcHash":     "<sha256 hex of friend_code + FC_SALT>"
}
```

Field rules:

- `code` — uppercase `[A-Z0-9]{6}`. The DLL passes whatever AU's `GameCode.IntToGameName` returns, uppercased.
- `region` — one of `NA` / `EU` / `AS`. The DLL normalizes:
  - `North America` → `NA`
  - `Europe` → `EU`
  - `Asia` → `AS`
  - (Anything else → don't announce — see fallback rules below.)
- `players` — 1..15. Current lobby occupancy at time of announce.
- `max` — 1..15. `GameOptions.MaxPlayers`.
- `mode` — short string ≤ 32 chars. End K not custom game mode name (`Standard`, `FFA`, `Speedrun`, ...). Empty → relay rewrites to `Standard`.
- `modVersion` — `Main.PluginVersion`. Empty → relay rewrites to `unknown`.
- `hostName` — host's Among Us name. Empty / control-only → relay rewrites to `Anonymous`. The relay strips `@`, control chars, and code-block escapes.
- `fcHash` — `sha256_hex(friend_code + FC_SALT)`. 64 lowercase hex chars.
  - `FC_SALT` is a constant string baked into the DLL. Public. Its only role is preventing rainbow-table lookups of arbitrary friend codes from a KV dump.

### `POST /api/update`

```json
{
  "code":    "ABCDEF",
  "fcHash":  "<same 64 hex>",
  "players": 5,
  "max":     15,
  "mode":    "Standard"
}
```

Field rules:
- `code` + `fcHash` — same validation as other lifecycle endpoints.
- `players`, `max`, `mode` — all optional. Only present fields are updated.
- If no field actually differs from the stored value, the relay returns
  `200 {"status":"no-change"}` and does NOT call Discord.
- The embed's status (open vs in-game) is preserved — `/api/update` never
  flips state, it only refreshes data fields.

### `POST /api/start`, `POST /api/end`, and `POST /api/close`

```json
{ "code": "ABCDEF", "fcHash": "<same 64 hex>" }
```

The relay verifies `fcHash` matches the value stored at announce time;
otherwise responds `403 fcHash mismatch`. This is the only ownership check
— sufficient for protecting against accidental cross-mutation, not
sufficient for a determined attacker.

**Lifecycle semantics:**
- `/api/start` flips the embed to amber "🎮 In Game" but the KV entry persists.
- `/api/end` flips the embed BACK to blurple "🎫 Lobby Open". The KV entry
  stays alive — the lobby is still in memory and rejoinable. This is what
  allows Play-Again to look correct in Discord without spamming new messages.
- `/api/close` is the actual terminal: DELETE Discord message + DELETE KV
  entry. The DLL fires this only when the host destroys the lobby (returns
  to MainMenu). Abandoned lobbies that never see /api/close are eventually
  swept by the KV TTL (`ANNOUNCE_TTL_SECONDS`, default 3h).

## Responses

All responses are JSON. Status codes:

| status | meaning |
|---|---|
| `200 {"status":"updated"}` | /api/update: one or more fields changed; embed PATCHed |
| `200 {"status":"no-change"}` | /api/update: all submitted fields matched stored values; no PATCH sent |
| `200 {"status":"announced","messageId":"..."}` | first announce, Discord message posted |
| `200 {"status":"refreshed","messageId":"..."}` | same host re-announced existing code; existing embed was PATCHed in place |
| `200 {"status":"ignored"}` | host is on denylist (silent ack — don't surface to user) |
| `200 {"status":"started"}` | start-edit succeeded |
| `200 {"status":"lobby-resumed"}` | end: embed flipped back to "open" (Play-Again ready) |
| `200 {"status":"closed"}` | close: Discord message + KV entry deleted |
| `200 {"status":"no-op"}` | start/end/close called for an unknown code (already expired or never announced) |
| `200 {"status":"kv-cleared","warn":"..."}` | close: KV cleared but Discord delete failed; UI should treat as success |
| `400 {"error":"..."}` | malformed body |
| `401 {"error":"bad signature"}` | HMAC/timestamp invalid |
| `403 {"error":"fcHash mismatch"}` | start/end called by wrong host |
| `409 {"error":"code already announced by another host"}` | someone else owns this code |
| `426 {"error":"version blocked — upgrade required"}` | `modVersion` listed in `BLOCKED_VERSIONS`; DLL should surface as "please update" |
| `429 {"error":"rate limited (ip\|host)"}` | DLL should back off ~RATE_LIMIT_SECONDS |
| `502 {"error":"discord post failed: ..."}` | upstream Discord error; retry later |

## DLL-side behavior expectations (Phase 2 must implement)

1. **Opt-in only.** Default-off. Toggle in Client Options: `ShareLobbyToDiscord`.
2. **Trigger points.**
   - announce: `LobbyBehaviour.Start` Postfix (delayed by a few seconds via LateTask
     until `PlayerControl.LocalPlayer` is available). Fires on both first-time and
     re-entry; server idempotently PATCHes on re-entry.
   - start: `ShipStatus.Begin` Postfix — only if announce succeeded.
   - end: `AmongUsClient.OnGameEnd` Postfix — only if announce succeeded.
     PATCHes the embed back to "open"; lobby still alive.
   - close: `LobbyBehaviour.OnDestroy` Postfix — gated by an `inGame` flag that is
     true between `start` and `end`. If `inGame=true` the OnDestroy is a
     lobby→ship transition and `close` is skipped; if `inGame=false` the host
     is leaving the lobby and `close` fires (DELETE message + KV).
3. **Fire-and-forget.** All HTTP via `UnityWebRequest` async; never block game thread.
4. **Failure UX.** Log + `Utils.SendMessage` to the host with the relay's error message. Match EHR's existing host-only error pattern.
5. **Idempotency.** OK to call `start` / `end` more than once. Relay treats unknown codes as `no-op`.
6. **Region exclusion.** If `IRegionInfo.Name` doesn't normalize to NA/EU/AS, don't announce (silently no-op). Don't crash.
7. **Android.** No platform exclusion. UnityWebRequest works the same way.
8. **HMAC key + FC_SALT.** Stored as `internal const` in `Modules/LobbyShareSecrets.cs` (gitignored; defaults to empty in `LobbyShareSecrets.Default.cs`). Both are extractable from the DLL — that's accepted. Rotation = ship a new release with a new key while leaving the old key in `SHARED_HMAC_KEYS` for a grace window so old DLLs keep working; remove the old key after the window (or immediately on confirmed leak).

## Things deliberately NOT in this contract

- Player-count update mid-lobby. (Could add a `/api/update` later.)
- Per-game-mode embed customization. (Mode is just a label.)
- AU matchmaker-side code verification. (Requires the host's EOS bearer token — out of scope for the MVP.)
- Multiple Discord channels. (One relay = one channel. Spin up another Worker for another channel.)
